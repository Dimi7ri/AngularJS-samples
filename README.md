AngularJS is a front end web development framework made to build Single Page Applications. Provides client side Model View Controller architecture.
The main objective of Angular is to convert web pages into web applications. 

</br>Angular Concepts.
</br>Directives: Angular extends HTML using directives, adding behaviours to DOM elements and its children.
</br>Modules: Angular apps don't have main methods, so each part of your app is contained by a module. (this keeps messy JS clean).
</br>Expressions: Angular uses expressions to bind data into HTML, can be written {{ example }} or inside of directives.
